# Unexpected Navigation Behavior with useNavigate in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useNavigate` hook in React Router v6. The issue arises from attempting to navigate to a route that doesn't exist in the `Routes` configuration, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Problem

The `About` component uses `useNavigate` to navigate to '/home'.  However, the route '/home' is not defined in the `Routes`. This results in the application either not navigating or displaying an error.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly defining the '/home' route within the `Routes` component or using the correct path if it already exists in a different part of the application.
